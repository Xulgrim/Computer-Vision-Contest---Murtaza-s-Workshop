# Computer-Vision-Contest---Murtaza-s-Workshop
The theme for the contest is Drone Surviellance

I made entirely all differents parts of this project using Opencv, Numpy and Imutils python librairies:
- Cars detection using differents thresholding methods like substraction of background color, image blurr, HSV masks, edges detection...
- Object tracking using Meanshift
- Flux based car counting
- Boxes drawing using the area of the box as Unique IDs for each vehicle
